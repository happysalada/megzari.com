    <h2 class="py-4 text-2xl">Why</h2>

        Nix
      </a> is a purely functional package manager, an alternative to HomeBrew.
      Pros:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Possibility to create isolated development environments. (no need for docker for development anymore)</li>
      <li>Space efficient! Each installation keeps a dependency tree and when a dependency is no longer needed it is removed.
         I'm sure it's what homebrew was supposed to do, but after 5 years there were so many packages I had no idea where they come from on my system.
         </li>
      <li>Fast! No benchmark on this, I'll let you try for yourself!</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="py-2">
      Cons:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Learning curve is a little steep. Nix uses it's own language to define packages. There is also a whole eco-system around Nix (feels a little bit like drinking from the hose at first)</li>
      <li>Documentation and examples are not so easy to find</li>
      <li>Update for a new version of package might take a little longer than other package managers to be available</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="py-2">
      The Nix package manager by itself is not really interesting, it starts to make full sense combining it with

        href="https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin"
      >

      </a>
       or
      <a
        class="text-blue-500 no-underline hover:underline"
        href="https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager"
      >
        home-manager
      </a>
        or both!
      Those projects enable you to build your system from a configuration file.
      Nix-darwin aims at configuring your MacOS (auto-hide the dock, enable 3 finger drag for trackpad...) and define some programs that should available for every users.
      Home manager goes one step further and enables you to define the configurations for those programs you install (no more messing with dotfiles and symlinks).
    </p>

    <p class="py-2">
      Should you do it?
      I would say you should be ready to invest a good weekend.
      Removing HomeBrew and switching completely to Nix freed 40 Gb of space for me.
      For development, not having to mess again with docker was a huge advantage too.
      If you don't want to use Nix for everything, you can still install binaries the old way.
      I still haven't switched my firefox and vscode installation (those are still the old binaries downloaded from the internet).

    <h2 class="py-4 text-2xl">How</h2>
    <h3 class="py-2 text-xl">Nix</h3>
    <p class="py-6">
      Instruction for installation can be found
      <a
        class="text-blue-500 no-underline hover:underline"
        href="https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/#sect-macos-installation"
      >
        here
      </a>. The installation can be multi user or single user.
      TLDR: only use single user when you are a nix expert.
      First pitfall! The default command for macos is for a single user install.
      You have to add --daemon at the end of it.
